<h2> Brief Description of CSC_quantification </h2>
CSC_quantification is a software tool developed on MATLAB, specifically designed to help neurologists measuring Cervical Spinal Cord atrophy and tracking Multiple Sclerosis  patients. 

<h2> System Requirements</h2>
CSC_quantification is developed on MATLAB R2023b, thus its system requirements are identical to those of MATLAB. The following are the minimum system requirements for running CSC_quantification:

<h3> Operating Systems </h3>
<i> - For Windows:  </i>
Windows 11, Windows 10 (version 21H2 or higher), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022.


<i> - For Linux </i>
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Debian 11, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (minimum 8.6), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (minimum 7.9), SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 15, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (minimum SP2), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.

<i> - For Mac </i>
macOS Sonoma (14), macOS Ventura (13), macOS Monterey (12.6),

<h3> Processor </h3>
Minimum: Any Intel or AMD x86-64 processor with two or more cores
Recommended: Any Intel or AMD x86-64 processor with four or more cores and AVX2 instruction set support 

<h3> RAM </h3>
Minimum: 8 GB, Recommended: 16 GB

<h3> Storage </h3>
3.8 GB for just MATLAB; 4-6 GB for a typical installation; 23 GB for an all products installation. An SSD is strongly recommended

<h3> Graphics </h3>
No specific graphics card is required, but a hardware accelerated graphics card supporting OpenGL 3.3 with 1GB GPU memory is recommended.

<h2> Installation </h2>

The software does not need any installation. It is sufficient to add the folders with subfolders to the Matlab path. 
Open the main matlab file labeled as 'Patient_Information.m' and Click Run.

Folder organization and quick start guide is included in PrepAnnECG Documentation file in documentation folder.





#Installation

Add the whole repository to your Matlab search path by addpath.m or by Home -> Set Path -> Add Folder.
#Sample File is stored in the folder "CSC_quantification"

#Manual Further details about how to use 'SC_quantific' can be found here SC_quantific_manual.pdf
