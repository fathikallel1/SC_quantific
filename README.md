<h2> Brief Description of CSC_quantification </h2>
CSC_quantification is a software tool developed on MATLAB, specifically designed to help neurologists measuring Cervical Spinal Cord atrophy and tracking Multiple Sclerosis  patients. 

<h2> System Requirements</h2>
CSC_quantification is developed on MATLAB R2023b, thus its system requirements are identical to those of MATLAB. The following are the minimum system requirements for running CSC_quantification:

<h3> Operating Systems </h3>
<i> - For Windows:  </i>
Windows 11, Windows 10 (version 21H2 or higher), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022.


<i> - For Linux </i>
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Debian 11, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (minimum 8.6), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (minimum 7.9), SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 15, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (minimum SP2), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.

<i> - For Mac </i>
macOS Sonoma (14), macOS Ventura (13), macOS Monterey (12.6),

<h3> Processor </h3>
Minimum: Any Intel or AMD x86-64 processor with two or more cores
Recommended: Any Intel or AMD x86-64 processor with four or more cores and AVX2 instruction set support 

<h3> RAM </h3>
Minimum: 8 GB, Recommended: 16 GB

<h3> Storage </h3>
3.8 GB for just MATLAB; 4-6 GB for a typical installation; 23 GB for an all products installation. An SSD is strongly recommended

<h3> Graphics </h3>
No specific graphics card is required, but a hardware accelerated graphics card supporting OpenGL 3.3 with 1GB GPU memory is recommended.

<h2> Installation </h2>
We propose two versions for our software. The fist one is shared as repository (CSC_quantification_MATLAB App) including all required matlab files (*.m and *.fig). Matlab software (version R2023b) should be installed with all required toolboxes on your computer. The second solution is shared as a as repository (CSC_quantification_Application) including a compiled MATLAB application (CSC_quantification Executable file: CSC_quantification.exe). You are able to Run this compiled MATLAB application without installing MATLAB. However, MATLAB Runtime (R2023b) should be installed. You can download and install the adequate version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2023b (available for Windows, Linux	and Mac) from the <a  href="www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html">following link</a>.

<h3> First solution: CSC_quantification_MATLAB App </h3>
Matlab software (version R2023b) should be installed. The CSC_quantification_MATLAB App does not need any installation. 
Add the whole repository to your Matlab search path by addpath.m or by Home -> Set Path -> Add Folder.

To read MRI image, SPM is needed. In fact, SPM is an academic software toolkit for the analysis of functional imaging data, for users familiar with the underlying statistical, mathematical and image processing concepts. It is made freely available to the imaging community, to promote collaboration and a common analysis scheme across laboratories. The software represents the implementation of the theoretical concepts of Statistical Parametric Mapping in a complete analysis package. The SPM software is a suite of (MATLAB) functions and subroutines with some externally compiled C routines. SPM was written to organise and interpret our functional neuroimaging data.

More details about SPM and link to download are available <a href="www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">here</a>. SPM folder should be added your Matlab search path by Home -> Set Path -> Add Folder.

#Sample File is stored in the folder "CSC_quantification". 
Open the main matlab file 'Patient_Information.m' and Click Run. Folder organization and quick start guide is included in CSC_quantification Documentation file in documentation folder.

<h3> Second solution: SC_quantification Executable </h3>
* Prerequisites for Deployment: Verify that MATLAB Runtime(R2023b) is installed. If not, you can run the MATLAB Runtime installer. To find its location, enter >>mcrinstaller at the MATLAB prompt.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. Alternatively, download and install the adequate version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2023b from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see "Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler documentation in the MathWorks Documentation Center.

* Files to Deploy and Package: 
      * CSC_quantification.exe
      * MCRInstaller.exe 
    Note: if end users are unable to download the MATLAB Runtime using the
    instructions in the previous section, include it when building your 
    component by clicking the "Runtime included in package" link in the
    Deployment Tool.
